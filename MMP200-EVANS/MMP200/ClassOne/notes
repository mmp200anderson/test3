# UX/UI and HTML

### A Praxis Study of Valve's Steam Desktop and BPM Interface, Netflix's
### Chrome Interface, and Twitter's mobile Interface

I have a hard time with "theory" of UX/UI Design, as it is my belief this
stuff is often

1. Based an outdated aesthetic that is appropriate primarily for print media
2. Based on early observations of unreliable sample sets.

I believe the best way to study UX/UI is to look at the platforms
that are currently reliant on UX/UI as the essence of multi-million and
multi-billion dollar companies.  There are more of these every day, and
certainly more than 3, but I have selected 3 because of my own personal
design experience.

We are going to do our best to clone some of these interfaces using only
html and css with the bootstrap framework.  Obviously the sites won't
be very functional (as HTML and CSS are "frontend" building blocks vs "backend")
but it will allow us to kill two appropriate birds with one stone:

1. Create basic important frontend components for web applications using HTML
and CSS
2. Understand what UX/UI components are essential to interfacing with multi-billion
dollar experiences

I know enough about the construction of web apps to where I can draw a clear
distinction between what can be done with vanilla html and css vs what can
be done with an object oriented programming langauge like ruby or a prototype
based language like javascript and the appropriate frameworks of such langauges.
This means I can utilize HTML and CSS to create a visual illustration of a
functional component, and I can in some cases explain how such a component
might be utilized by a more complex set of backend tools and techniques.

FIRST:
Show off CSS Zen Garden - A couple old things, show how cool it was and
how attractive, during this phase CSS was new and not a standard of the web.
People were still pushing HTML itself to limits (think of a world before iPhones) .
I remember working in a bookstore back when iPod touches were first being released
and these "HTML WITH CSS" books started popping up, but twitter didn't even
exist, facebook did but was cutting edge, PHP MyAdmin was certainly around but
that was far beyond anyone just designing a simple personal site.  CSS was
very cool for people that had been cobbling together UIs with HTML tables...
I can't even find the old Wired Webmonkey tutorials I worked through back in the
late 90s early 2000s.

So once people understood to change fonts and colors and add grid systems
without breaking their brains they needed CSS.  Quickly after this the smart phone
revolution happened and suddenly a new buzzword entered the web design zeitgeist:
Responsive.

Responsive is basically a hipper way to say "Mobile First" or "tactile" -- Buttons
made for people interacting with your site from a device as the most important...
the mouse click becomes a secondary player, and UI becomes a quest for engagement
time.  Enter twitter bootstrap: a type of CSS framework that keeps the nerdy
programmer from putting out great ideas in a way that looks gross.
